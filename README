This directory contains an IDL code that I am currently working on.  I am conducting an observational search for supermassive black hole binaries.  As the main test, I make an analogy to single-line spectroscopic binary stars and look for radial velocity shifts in the broad Hb line of quasars.  I typically have a handful of points spanning a small fraction of the period of the hypothetical binaries.  The measurements are made relative to an anchor point, the first observation.  The simulation that I include is designed to identify the shortest period for a sinusoid that is consistent with the data, which can help put limits on the mass of the binary.  The simulation is necessary for a fair treatment of the uncertainties.  This code is under construction, with the primary improvement being a better exploration of parameter space.  I've written a simple wrapper for the simulation, call_mc.pro, which you can run by typing:

IDL>.r call_mc
IDL>call_mc

This directory contains code samples that deal with big data.  These are for reference only and will not run without access to the SDSS data stored on Wyoming servers.

This directory contains a visual inspection tool for looking at TDSS data as they are observed.  I started from John Ruan's version of the tool and modified it heavily for multi-epoch spectroscopy.  I have included sample data (you will need to unzip the spPlate file which was too big for github) so you can run the tool with the command:

python tdssVIP.v2.0.py 7275 57093

This directory contains exercises written in C++.  These may need to be recompiled, depending on your system architecture (they run with Mac OSX version 10.10.4).  They can be called by typing the name of the executable.
